When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- working with other people who aren't at the same place or don't work in the same local network
- sharing source code for other people to develop

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- if someone adds changes that you dont want on your local repository
- generally allows more control over local rep
