When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- working with other people who aren't at the same place or don't work in the same local network
- sharing source code for other people to develop

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- if someone adds changes that you dont want on your local repository
- generally allows more control over local rep

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy of repository as new repository on GitHub that refers to the forked rep; good for modifying an existing repository and sharing it as a new repository
clone: local copy of a repository; good for making changes to an existing repository on your local machine
branch: commit parallel to other commits inside a specific repository; good for new features
